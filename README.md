# tRacket-api
API to register tRacket sensors, log measurements and access locations and their measurements.

The code uses the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) to implement the tRacket API.  More specifically, it is implemented as a [webCOMAND Package](https://www.webcomand.com/docs/api/php/io_comand_package/) using the [cMVC Framework](https://www.webcomand.com/docs/api/php/io_comand_mvc/).

The API is used by [tRacket Sensors](https://github.com/CivicTechTO/proj-noisemeter-device), the [tRacket Dashboard](https://github.com/CivicTechTO/tRacket-dashboard) and the [tRacket Sensor Manager](https://github.com/CivicTechTO/tRacket-sensor-manager).

The API endpoints will eventually be documented here, but for now can be found in the [tRacket API Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJ5xTEEhl2W9Ikjd6QiF1yvooPhU_E1yJJCPvLu234s/).
